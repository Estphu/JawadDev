                <div class="bio site-article">
                    <p>My tale of falling in love with Python and Django comes before my tale of falling in love with programming. I excelled in math and logical problem-solving during my school years. I believe the reason for that was that I had a home tutor for math. I had a Dell Pentium 4 when I first started using computers at a young age. We purchased it sometime in 2009 or 2010. It was a positive experience, and I'm happy I had it.</p>
                    <p>Initially, I acquired knowledge about Microsoft Excel through an online course. Almost all of Excel's formulas and shortcuts were familiar to me at the time, I recalled. Though I wasn't old enough to use it in my career, I was good at it. Upon acquiring that ability, I chose to focus on designing rather than advancing it.</p>
                    <p>I spent a lot of time designing. Initially, I didn't take a formal course in it, but instead watched a lot of tutorials. I've since completed online courses in Photoshop and Illustrator. Photoshop was the software I was using to work with. For 3D modeling, use Blender, Adobe Illustrator, and for video editing I was usingÂ Adobe Premiere Pro. From the end of my high school career until the middle of my college career, I was interested in designing. By using Photoshop, I was able to do freelance work. I was never able to use Blender in a professional manner because I was ignorant of 3D modeling. I also thought about learning Figma for user interface design as a skill. Ironically, though, it was during our talk that my friend 'Aaka' introduced me to programming. Since networking piqued his interest more than anything, he advised me to study front-end programming and take courses at Codecademy.</p>
                    <p>It was the end of 2016. Since then, I have been learning HTML 5 and CSS 3 while developing and using front-end development techniques. I was astounded that a few lines of my code could make changes appear in the browser and that it also corresponded with my prior knowledge. I've developed an interest, so I've decided to major in either software engineering or computer science.</p>
                    <p>I took admission in COMSATS Abbottabad, It was very far from my home city. So I had to made a little sacrifice for it and live as a hostellite for 4 years. I've learned the core concepts of programming languages and many basic concepts about other relative field like compilers, networking, machine learning, artficial intelligence and microprocessor computing. I also had my first job as an internee there in Abbottix. After that I got permanent and had almost 2 years of experience as a Web Developer.</p>
                    <p>In seven semesters, I finished all of my computer science courses, including my final year project, which focused on developing a mobile application that connects influencers and businesses to conduct business. Businessmen could pay influencers to promote their brands. And business owners could find the ideal influencer to promote their product by simply filtering their needs and finding the right influencer to do so.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of mobile applications I worked as a freelancer in Flutter for 1.5 years. I completed two of Angela Yu's premium courses on Udemy. She is a Google Flutter Expert. Yes, I realize that I've mentioned my different skills frequently, but I enjoy learning. Because Flutter is a cross-platform framework, I found it to be very fascinating. In it, I've constructed numerous projects.</p>

                        <h5 class="fw-bold mb-4">My Introduction To Programming</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>My professional introduction to programming I would say was when I got introduce to a C language in my first semster. I become more familiar with ideas like variables, if-else statements, and Object Oriented Programming. I then understand how the logic of the software's back end works. My understanding of how our data is stored and relationships formed between them has also improved thanks to the database course.</p>
                    <p>Python was first presented during my second semester. Its widespread use led me to conclude right away that the language was strong and powerful. However, I decided against it because I was intrigued by Flutter at the time. I did go for it during my fifth semester machine learning course, when I started a Python course offered by Pierian Training.</p>

                                <td>
                                    <p>From then, I read a book called <a class="theme-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Taught-Programmer-Definitive-Programming-Professionally-ebook/dp/B01M01YDQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">'The Self-Taught Programmer' by Cory Althoff</a> which advocated the use of Python. I noticed that the language was written in an expressive and intuitive way that I considered would be the way that I would write a programming language.</p>
                                    <p>It was around May 2018 when I encountered Python and have studied it avidly ever since.</p>
                                    <p>One of the big stories in the Python community shortly after getting started was Guido Van Rossum (the inventor of the language and known in the community as the Benevolent Dictator For Life) was stepping down from being Python's leader.</p>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>A bit of further research led me to realise its popularity as a language for scripting, web development, and data analysis.</p>
                    <p>I required a framework that would allow me to fully utilize my Python knowledge and experience, beyond just using it in the command prompt. I therefore had two options for the framework: Django and Flask. I selected Django because it supports ORM, which eliminated the need for me to write SQL queries for my database, and it uses the MVT architectural structure, which is more structured. You only need to write Python classes and attributes for WSGI and ORM to take care of it for you.</p>
                    <p>I continued my learning journey by studying more courses on Udemy, reading books, and writing scripts. When GitHub introduced free private repositories, I started to create more projects and push them to my remote repos.</p>
                    <p>After feeling more confident with my code, I started using public repositories too and finally building a portfolio which has grown considerably in time both in terms of the number of projects, the variety of features and the testing coverage.</p>

                        <p>I can add sprinklings of JavaScript to my projects to augment their functionality. This is evidenced with some of the features across my portfolio.</p>
