          The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of the <em>requests,</em> <em>BeautifulSoup</em>, <em>Selenium</em> for dynamic data handling and <em>re</em> libraries to handle web tasks such as getting content from websites, parsing their HTML and extracting color from style tags.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text mx-3">The Django component of the application handles the navigation patterns (urls), the request/response application logic (views) and the rendering of the final result (templates).</p>

                <strong>Please be patient waiting for the results page to load</strong> as the process is
                requesting and scraping data from an Al-Jazeera Page that has dynamic values which means, 
                the page itself has to request the server to get the data (Selenium is used for interacting).
                The scraping process should respect the frequency of requests to the Al-Jazeera server.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, this sort of process would be set up as something like a scheduled Celery task
                so fresh data can be accessed directly from the database. Of course, results
                are dynamic in nature.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Selenium is using chrome for interaction. So, chrome should be installed in your system</p>
